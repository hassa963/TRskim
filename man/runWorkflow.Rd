\title{Running the TRskim Workflow}
\usage{
runWorkflow(alleles, motifs, match_score = 1, indel = -1, allowance = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{alleles}{A \code{DNAStringSet} or character vector of tandem repeat alleles.}

\item{motifs}{A vector of strings or a \code{DNAStringSet} representing the
expected motifs of the tandem repeat.}

\item{match_score}{Numeric. Score assigned when a motif matches the sequence.
Default is \code{1}.}

\item{indel}{Numeric. Score assigned for an insertion or deletion in the
sequence. Default is \code{-1}.}

\item{allowance}{Integer. Number of mismatches allowed between the motif and
the sequence for it to still be encoded as that motif. Default is \code{0}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{decomposition}{The tandem repeat alleles decomposed into their
constituent motifs.}
\item{encoded}{The encoded tandem repeats.}
\item{motif_map}{Mapping of motifs to single-character symbols used in the
encoding.}
\item{alignment}{Character matrix representing the aligned tandem repeats.}
\item{bar_plot}{Bar plot visualization of motif frequencies at each
position.}
\item{tile_plot}{Tile plot visualization of motif composition across
alleles.}
}
\description{
Performs all steps of the TRskim workflow, including decomposition, encoding,
alignment, and visualization of tandem repeats.
