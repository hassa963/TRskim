\title{Tandem Repeat Decomposition}
\usage{
decomposeTR(allele, motifs, match = 1, indel = -1, allowence = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{allele}{DNAString or character string of the Tandem repeat}

\item{motifs}{a vector of strings or a DNAStringSet that are the expected
motifs of the Tandem Repeat}

\item{match}{score for if motif matches sequence this is by default 1}

\item{indel}{score for if there is an insertion or deletion in sequence by
default this is -1}

\item{allowence}{is the number of mismatches between the motif
and the sequence permitted to be still be later encoded as a motif. By
default this is 0}
}
\value{
This function returns the tandem repeat allele decomposed into its motifs
as a character vector. For example, the allele \code{"ATATAT"} with motif \code{"AT"}
is decomposed into \code{c("AT", "AT", "AT")}.

If no motifs are found in the allele, the function returns \code{character(0)}
and prints a message to inform the user.

Any indels within the repeat are represented as \code{"-"} in the output vector.
Each \code{"-"} represents an indel the length of the preceding motif unit.
For example, \code{"ATATCAT"} with motif \code{"AT"} is decomposed into
\code{c("AT", "AT", "-", "AT")}.
}
\description{
A function that decomposes an allele into the supplied motifs given either a
character string or DNAString of the allele
