\title{Aligning Tandem Repeats}
\usage{
alignTRs(encoded_trs)
}
\arguments{
\item{encoded_trs}{A vector of encoded tandem repeats}
}
\value{
A character matrix representing the aligned tandem repeats, where
each row corresponds to an input sequence and each column to an aligned
motif position.
}
\description{
Aligns multiple encoded tandem repeat sequences by motif using a simple
progressive pairwise alignment algorithm
}
\details{
\strong{Algorithm:}
The function uses progressive alignment with the following strategy:
\enumerate{
\item Sequences are sorted by length (longest first)
\item The longest sequence initializes the alignment profile
\item Shorter sequences are progressively aligned to the growing profile
\item When gaps are inserted into the profile, all previously aligned sequences
are updated to maintain column consistency
\item Leading gap-only columns are removed from the final alignment
}

\strong{Alignment Method:}
Pairwise alignments use the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with:
\itemize{
\item Match score: +2
\item Mismatch penalty: -1
\item Gap penalty: -2
}

\strong{Assumptions and Limitations:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{Length-based ordering}: Assumes longer sequences are more "complete" and
should anchor the alignment. This works well for TRs
where length differences reflect copy number variation.
\item \strong{Order-independent}: Results depend only on sequence content and lengths,
not input order.
\item \strong{Not phylogeny-aware}: Does not consider evolutionary relationships
between sequences.
\item \strong{Best for similar sequences}: Works well when sequences share a common
motif structure with varying copy numbers. May perform poorly on highly
divergent sequences.
\item \strong{Small to medium datasets}: Designed for typical TR locus analysis
(< 100 sequences). For very large datasets, consider specialized MSA tools.
